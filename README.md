# Beacons Registration API

This is a Spring Boot API to enable:

- [406Mhz beacon](https://www.gov.uk/maritime-safety-weather-and-navigation/register-406-mhz-beacons) owners to register
  their details with the Maritime & Coastguard Agency
- Search and rescue [Mission Control Centres](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_centre_(Cospas-Sarsat)>) to
  retrieve information about beacons during distress signal activations

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build and test the application.

| Dependency                                               | Version |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)                        | 11      |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) | Latest  |
| [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)                         | 14.x    |

Gradle is the build tool for the application. See
the [docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:upgrading_wrapper) for updating the Gradle
Wrapper.

## Development

Clone this repo.

Set the Node environment using `nvm use` (having installed [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

Install node packages (needed for code formatting): `npm install`

## Local development

The service can be run either locally in your IDE of choice or from the command line by
running: `./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'`

Local development instances of the backing services, such as PostgreSQL and OpenSearch, can be initiated with the
command `docker compose up`.

## Testing

Integration tests use the naming convention `<name>IntegrationTest`. Unit tests use the naming convention
`<name>UnitTest`.

Both unit and integration tests go in [src/test/java/uk/gov/mca/beacons/api](src/test/java/uk/gov/mca/beacons/api).

### Running tests

- `./gradlew test` runs unit tests
- `./gradlew integrationTest` runs integration tests
- `./gradlew check` runs both unit and integration tests

## Style guide

We use [Prettier-Java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java/tree/c1f867092f74ebfdf68ccb843f8186c943bfdeca) to
format our code and use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to run the formatting as a pre-commit hook.

Wildcard imports, `import java.util.*;` should not be used within the application.
See [GDS Programming Languages](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/manuals/programming-languages/java.html#imports)
guidance on this and how to configure IntelliJ to ensure it does not use wildcard imports.

As well as during the pre-commit hook, the formatter can be run manually with:

```bash
$ npm run format
```

## Deployment

A Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is configured to deploy to our development environment on
merges into the `main` branch.

Please see the [Beacons Integration](https://github.com/mcagov/beacons-integration) project which manages the
infrastructure-as-code and deployments for the application.

## Database schema diagram

With the Beacons Service API running, execute `docker compose up -f docker-compose.schemacrawler.yml`. This will create
a diagram of the database schema at
[schemacrawler/beacons-schema.html](schemacrawler/beacons-schema.html).
